# SAM Reborn - 2026

**A modern revival of the legendary [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager).**

## About the Project

Steam Achievement Manager (SAM) was originally released in 2008 and became the go-to tool for managing Steam achievements. However, its development effectively stopped over a decade ago.

**SAM Reborn** is a fork of the original project. I have picked up the pieces to bring this essential tool into the modern era. The core functionality remains, but the experience has been completely overhauled with a modern design and powerful new features.

## What's New?

This isn't just a visual skin; it's a complete modernization of the experience:

- **Modern User Interface**: A sleek, dark-themed UI that looks at home on modern Windows.
- **Timer Mode**: Simulate completely natural achievement unlocks over time. Set a delay, and watch them unlock one by one.
- **Random Unlocker**: Generate random unlock times for realistic intervals between achievements.
- **Improved Performance**: Faster loading and filtering of your library.
- **Single File Executable**: No more clutter. Just one `.exe` file to verify and run.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the latest release from the `Dist` folder.
2. **Execute** `SAM.Reborn.2026.exe`.
3. Select a game from your library.
4. Unlock (or lock!) achievements to your heart's content.

_Note: Steam must be running and you must be logged in._
