## About the Project

**SLAM** is a transformative evolution of the original [Steam Achievement Manager (SAM)](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager), which made its debut in 2008. Though development on SAM came to a halt over a decade ago, I took it upon myself to revitalize this essential tool for today’s gamers. SLAM preserves the key functionalities that made SAM a favorite while delivering a completely reimagined experience through modern design and powerful new features.

## What's New?

This isn't just a visual skin; it's a complete modernization of the experience:

- **Modern User Interface**: A sleek, dark-themed UI that looks at home on modern Windows.
- **Timer Mode**: Simulate completely natural achievement unlocks over time. Set a delay, and watch them unlock one by one.
- **Random Unlocker**: Generate random unlock times for realistic intervals between achievements.
- **Non-Achievement Game Support**: Rack up hours or drop trading cards for games without achievements.
- **Improved Performance**: Faster loading and filtering of your library.
- **Single File Executable**: No more clutter. Just one `.exe` file to verify and run.
- **Dark Mode**: A dark theme that's easy on the eyes and easy on the battery.
- **Image Caching**: Cached images are stored in the `cache` folder, making the app faster and more responsive.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the latest release from the `Dist` folder.
2. **Execute** `SLAM.exe`.
3. **???**
4. **Profit**

_Note: Steam must be running and you must be logged in._
